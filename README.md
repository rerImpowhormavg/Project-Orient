# Insight-Project

## Project description
The goal of this project is to build a recommendation system for “social-like” content (news would be a good start) where the recommendations are clearly explained (ie your Twitter feed is like this because you are 60% democrat, older than 45, working in tech, etc...), and tunable. This addresses the issues of recommendation algorithms creating negative feedback loops, and allows users to be aware of the profile they are building, and tune it to see the content that interests them.
